## 💡 Reliability

---

### 📝 Definition:
> **Probability a system will not fail in a given period.**

---

### 🌱 Importance:
- Ensures continuous service despite component failures.

---

### 🔒 Redundancy:
- Use of software and data replicas to eliminate single points of failure.

---

### 🌐 Example:
> E-commerce store (like Amazon) ensuring transactions continue even if one server fails.

---

### 🎨 Visual:
> Imagine a chain made of strong links, each representing a reliable component in the system. Even if one link breaks, the chain remains intact due to redundancy.

---

### 📚 Practice Questions:

1. What is the primary goal of redundancy in distributed systems?
2. How does reliability ensure continuous service in a system?
3. Can a system be reliable without being redundant? Why or why not?

### 🧠 Review - Method of Loci:

To remember the concepts of Reliability, imagine walking through your home:

- **Entrance**: You're welcomed by a doorman named "Reliability," reminding you of the system's **"probability not to fail"**.
- **Living Room**: There's a TV displaying continuous streaming, symbolizing **"continuous service despite failures"**.
- **Kitchen**: You find a fridge with multiple identical food items, representing **"redundancy and replicas"**.
- **Bedroom**: You see an Amazon package on your bed, reminding you of the **e-commerce store ensuring continuous transactions**.

Visit this mental path regularly to reinforce your understanding of Reliability.
