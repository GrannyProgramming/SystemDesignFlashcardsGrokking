## Availability 🌟

---

### Definition 📝:
**Percentage of time a system remains operational under normal circumstances.**

---

### Importance 🌱:
- A major influencer of user experience and trust.

---

### Key Factors 🛠️:
1. Maintenance procedures and frequency 🔧
2. Duration of repairs 🕰️
3. Accessibility to spare parts 📦

---

### Distinction ⚖️:
> **While high reliability can lead to high availability, a system with high availability isn't invariably reliable.**

---

### Illustrative Example 🌐:
An **online store** with consistent uptime (high availability) yet plagued by security vulnerabilities (low reliability).

---

### Visual Mnemonic 🎨:
> Visualize a **clock**. The unbroken hands showcase the system's uptime. Disruptions or malfunctions are depicted by interruptions in the clock hands.

---

### Practice Questions 📚:
1. Elaborate on the distinctions between reliability and availability in a distributed system context.
2. Which elements can detrimentally impact a system's availability?
3. Discuss the significance of maintaining high system availability.

### Memory Technique - Method of Loci 🧠:

Embark on a journey through your residence:

- **Entrance**: A radiant sun welcomes you, emblematic of a system's **"uninterrupted operational state"**.
- **Living Room**: An ornate clock hangs, its hands showcasing occasional gaps, representing **"system's uptime and downtime"**.
- **Kitchen**: Spot tools (a wrench, a timer, and a spare widget) neatly laid out, signifying the **"determinants of availability"**.
- **Bedroom**: A bed flanked by a sturdy safe on one end and a fractured lock on the other serves as a reminder of the **contrast between reliability and availability**.

Revisit this mental trail periodically to bolster your grasp on Availability.
