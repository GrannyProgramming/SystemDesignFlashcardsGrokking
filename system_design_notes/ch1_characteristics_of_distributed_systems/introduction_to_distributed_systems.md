### 🧠 Review - Method of Loci:
To remember the concepts of Distributed Systems, envision walking through your home:

- **Entrance**: As you open the door, you see a spider web, with each strand connecting to various points, symbolizing the **"network of interconnected nodes"**.
- **Living Room**: On the coffee table, there's a puzzle with multiple pieces coming together to form a picture, representing nodes working **"together to achieve a common goal"**.
- **Kitchen**: You notice a spice rack, each jar labeled with characteristics: Scalability, Reliability, and so on. This reminds you of the **"Key Characteristics"** of distributed systems.
- **Bedroom**: On the bed, there's a book titled "The Power of Networks", emphasizing the importance of interconnected systems.

Revisit this journey in your mind to solidify your understanding of Distributed Systems.
