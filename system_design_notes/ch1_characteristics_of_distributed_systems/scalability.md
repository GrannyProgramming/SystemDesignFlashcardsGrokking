## 📈 Scalability

---

### 📝 Definition: 
> **Ability of a system to grow and manage increased demand.**

---

### 🌱 Importance: 
- Supports growing work without performance loss.

---

### 🚀 Challenges: 
- 🌐 Network speed
- 💰 Management cost
- 🚧 Distribution limitation

---

### 🔀 Types of Scaling: 

**Horizontal Scaling**:
> Adding more servers.  
> 🌍 **Example**: Cassandra, MongoDB

**Vertical Scaling**:
> Enhancing existing server power (CPU, RAM).  
> 🖥️ **Example**: MySQL

---

### 🎨 Visual: 
> Imagine two graphs. One graph (Horizontal) gets wider as more nodes (servers) are added. The other graph (Vertical) gets taller as more resources (CPU, RAM) are added to a single node.

---

### 📚 Practice Questions:

1. What are the two main types of scaling in distributed systems?
2. Which type of scaling involves adding more servers? Which involves enhancing existing server power?
3. Name a database system that's a good example of horizontal scaling.

### 🧠 Review - Method of Loci:

To remember the concepts of Scalability, imagine walking through your home:

- **Entrance**: You see a growing plant, symbolizing the growth and **"ability of a system to manage increased demand"**.
- **Living Room**: There's a big screen showing a graph expanding in width (Horizontal) and another in height (Vertical), illustrating the **two types of scaling**.
- **Kitchen**: You find a balance scale with a server on one side and a CPU chip on the other, signifying the balance between **Horizontal and Vertical Scaling**.
- **Bedroom**: There are two beds; one is expanding in width (Cassandra & MongoDB) while the other in height (MySQL), representing examples of each scaling type.
